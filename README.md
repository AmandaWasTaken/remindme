Complete rewrite of my old program using SDL2 instead of xlib

This is just a program I made to make sure my pizza doesn't burn (and to learn SDL2) but I made this repo public so ppl could roast my shit code lol

# Build
make

# Usage
./main <topic> <time> (seconds)
(or copy the executable to /usr/bin for convenience)

# TODO
- Add cool colors to the window
- Make the window.c code less ugly and poopy and shite
